<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Perform surface temperature adjustment once every Nevery steps.
This command reads in a compute or fix ID that should be
the flux of total energy on the surface elements (<I>etot</I> from
<A HREF = "compute_surf.html">compute_surf</A>, i.e. the total surface heat flux).
</P>
<P>The specified <I>group-ID</I> must be the name of a surf element group, as
defined by the <A HREF = "group.html">group grid</A> command, which contains a set
of surf elements.
</P>
<P>The specfied <I>Nevery</I> determines how often a surface temperature adjustment
operation is performed.
</P>
<P>The <I>source</I> can be specified as a per surf element quantity calculated
by a compute, such as <A HREF = "compute_surf.html">compute_surf</A>,
e.g. the total surface heat flux <I>etot</I>.
It can also be specified a per surf quantity
calculated by a fix, such as <A HREF = "fix_ave_surf.html">fix_ave/surf</A>.  That
fix could time average per-surf quantities from per surf
computes.
</P>
<P>The model has 2 parameters set by the <I>Tsurf</I> and <I>emisurf</I> arguments.
<I>Tsurf</I> is the initial temperature of the surface.  <I>emisurf</I> is an emissivity
coefficient from 0.0 to 1.0, which determines the emissivity of the surface.
An emissivity coefficient of 1.0 means that the surface is a black-body
that radiates all the energy it receives.
</P>
<HR>
<P>The surface temperature is calculated from the Stefan-Boltzmann law for
a gray-body, which states that
q_wall = sigma * emisurf * Tsurf ^ 4
where sigma is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, <I>emisurf</I> is the specified
surface emissivity, and <I>Tsurf</I> is the surface temperature.

<P><B>Restart, output info:</B>
</P>
<P>No information about this fix is written to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart
files</A>.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>At the moment, this fix can only be used in simulations that define explicit
non-distributed surfaces. Distributed and implicit surface support will be
added at a later time.
