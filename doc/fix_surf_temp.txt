fix surf_temp command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID surf/temp group-ID Nevery source Tsurf emisurf:pre

ID is documented in "fix"_fix.html command :ulb,l
surf/temp = style name of this fix command :l
group-ID = ID of group of grid cells that contain explicit surfaces :l
Nevery = perform surface temperature adjustment once every Nevery steps :l
source = computeID or fixID :l
  computeID = c_ID or c_ID\[n\] for a compute that calculates per surf values
  fixID = f_ID or f_ID\[n\] for a fix that calculates per surf values
Tsurf = initial temperature of surface (temperature units)
emisurf = emissivity of the surface (unitless, 0 < emisurf <= 1)

:ule

[Examples:]

fix 1 surf/temp all 1000 c_1 800 0.9 :pre

[Description:]

Perform surface temperature adjustment once every Nevery steps.
This command reads in a compute or fix ID that should be
the flux of total energy on the surface elements ({etot} from
"compute surf"_compute_surf.html, i.e. the total surface heat flux).

The specified {group-ID} must be the name of a surf element group, as
defined by the "group grid"_group.html command, which contains a set
of surf elements.

The specfied {Nevery} determines how often a surface temperature adjustment
operation is performed.

The {source} can be specified as a per surf element quantity calculated
by a compute, such as "compute surf"_compute_surf.html,
e.g. the total surface heat flux {etot}.
It can also be specified a per surf quantity
calculated by a fix, such as "fix ave/surf"_fix_ave_surf.html.  That
fix could time average per-surf quantities from per surf
computes.

The model has 2 parameters set by the {Tsurf} and {emisurf} arguments.
{Tsurf} is the initial temperature of the surface.  {emisurf} is an emissivity
coefficient from 0.0 to 1.0, which determines the emissivity of the surface.
An emissivity coefficient of 1.0 means that the surface is a black-body
that radiates all the energy it receives.

:line

The surface temperature is calculated from the Stefan-Boltzmann law for
a gray-body, which states that
q_wall = sigma * emisurf * Tsurf ^ 4
where sigma is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, {emisurf} is the specified
surface emissivity, and {Tsurf} is the surface temperature.

[Restart, output info:]

No information about this fix is written to "binary restart
files"_restart.html.

[Restrictions:]

At the moment, this fix can only be used in simulations that define explicit
non-distributed surfaces. Distributed and implicit surface support will be
added at a later time.
