<P>These commands will dump time averages for the mean free path and mean

</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Define a computation that calculates the mean free path (lambda)
and mean collision time (tau) between molecular collisions for each grid cell,
based on the particles in that cell.
Optionally, a Knudsen number for each cell
can also be calculated, which is the mean free path divided by the
cell size.  These quantities can be useful for estimating the optimal
grid cell size when adapting the grid, e.g. via the
<A HREF = "adapt_grid.html">adapt_grid</A> or <A HREF = "fix_adapt_grid.html">fix adapt/grid</A>
commands, as well as the optimal time step size.
</P>
<P>Unlike other computes that calculate per grid cell values, this
compute does not take a "group-ID" for a grid cell group as an
argument, nor a particle <A HREF = "mixture.html">mixture</A> ID as an argument.
This is because it uses the number density and temperature calculated
by other computes or fixes as input, and those computes or fixes use
grid group IDs or mixture IDs as part of their computations.
</P>
<P>The results of this compute can be used by different commands in
different ways.  For example, the values can be output by the
<A HREF = "dump.html">dump grid</A> command.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The formula used to calculate the mean free path (lambda) is given in
<A HREF = "#Bird94">(Bird94)</A> as equation 4.77:
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "Eqs/lambda.jpg">
</CENTER>
<P>The formula used to calculate the mean collision time (tau) is given in
<A HREF = "#Bird94">(Bird94)</A> as equation 1.38 combined with 4.75:
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "Eqs/tau.jpg">
</CENTER>
<P>These are the exact mean free path and mean collision time for a multi-species mixture,
suitable for estimating optimal grid cell sizes and timestep as explained above.
</P>
<P>dref and Tref and omega are collision properties for a pair of species
species in the flow.
</P>
<P>Specifically, Dref is the diameter of molecules of the species pair, Tref
is the reference temperature, and omega is the viscosity
temperature-dependence for the species pair.
</P>
<P>In the formula above, <I>n</I> is the number density and <I>T</I> is the thermal
temperature of particles in a grid cell.  This compute does not
calculate these quantities itself; instead it uses another compute or
fix to perform the calculation.  This is done by specifying the <I>nrho</I>
and <I>temp</I> arguments like this:
</P>
<UL><LI>c_ID = compute with ID that calculates temp as a vector output
<LI>c_ID[m] = compute with ID that calculates temp as its Mth column of array output
<LI>c_ID[*] = compute with ID that calculates nrho as an array output
<LI>f_ID[m] = fix with ID that calculates a time-averaged temp as a vector output
<LI>f_ID[m] = fix with ID that calculates a time-averaged temp as its Mth column of array output
<LI>f_ID[*] = fix with ID that calculates a time-averaged nrho as an array output
</UL>
<P>The <I>temp</I> argument can also be specified as NULL, which drops the
(Tref/T) ratio term from the formula above.  That is also effectively
the case if the reference species defines omega = 1/2.  In that case,
the <I>temp</I> argument is ignored, whether it is NULL or not.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: In this new version of <A HREF = "compute_lambda_grid.html">compute_lambda/grid</A>,
a per species number density array calculated by either a compute or a fix has to be specified.
The code will automatically detect the number of species in the mixture to perform
the mean free path and mean collision time calculation.
The <A HREF = "compute_grid.html">compute_grid</A> command with mixture "species" has to be invoked
to ensure that the number density of all the species in the mixture is computed.
</P>
<P>Note that if the value of <I>n</I> is 0.0 for a grid cell, its
mean-free-path and mean-collision-time will be set to 1.0e20 (infinite length and time).
</P>
<P>The <A HREF = "compute_grid.html">compute_grid</A> command can calculate a number
density, using its <I>nrho</I> value.  It can also calculate a temperature
using its <I>temp</I> value.  Note that this temperature is inferred from
the translational kinetic energy of the particles, which is only
appopriate for a mean free path calculation for systems with zero or
small streaming velocities.  For systems with streaming flow, an
appropriate temperature can be calculated by the <A HREF = "compute_thermal_grid.html">compute
thermal/grid</A> command.  The formulas on its
doc page show that the the center-of-mass velocity from the particles
in each grid cell is subtracted from each particle's velocity to yield
a translational thermal velocity, from which a thermal temperature is
calculated.
</P>
<P>The <A HREF = "fix_ave_grid.html">fix ave/grid</A> command can calculate the same
values in a time-averaged sense, assuming it uses these same computes
as input.  Using this fix as input to this compute will thus yield
less noisy values, due to the time averaging.
</P>
<P>Note that the compute or fix (via the compute(s) it uses as input) has to
perform its number density calculation for a subset of
the particles based on the "mixture" it uses.  See the
<A HREF = "mixture.html">mixture</A> command for how a set of species can be
partitioned into groups.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: If the ID of a <A HREF = "fix_ave_grid.html">fix ave/grid</A>
command is used as the <I>nrho</I> or <I>temp</I> argument, it only produces
output on timesteps that are multiples of its <I>Nfreq</I> argument.  Thus
this compute can only be invoked on those timesteps.  For example, if
a <A HREF = "dump.html">dump grid</A> command invokes this compute to write values
to a dump file, it must do so on timesteps that are multiples of
<I>Nfreq</I>.
</P>
<P>One of the <I>kall</I> or <I>kx</I> or <I>ky</I> or <I>kz</I> extra arguments can be
optionally appended.  If specified, this calculates an additional
value per grid cell, namely the dimensionless Knudsen number which is
the ratio of the mean free path to the cell size.  For <I>kall</I>, the
cell size is taken to be the average of the three grid cell side
lengths (or two cell lengths for a 2d simulation).  For <I>kx</I>, <I>ky</I>, or
<I>kz</I>, the cell size is the single cell side length in the
corresponding x,y,z dimension.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>Output info:</B>
</P>
<P>This compute calculates a per-grid array.  If one of <I>kall</I>,
<I>kx</I>, <I>ky</I>, or <I>kz</I> is not specified, then it is an array with two columns.
If one extra argument is specified, it is an array with three columns.  The
vector or first column of the array is the mean free path; the second
column is the mean collision time; the third is the Knudsen number.
</P>
<P>This compute performs calculations for all flavors of child grid cells
in the simulation, which includes unsplit, cut, split, and sub cells.
See <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_8">Section 6.8</A> of the manual gives
details of how SPARTA defines child, unsplit, split, and sub cells.
Note that cells inside closed surfaces contain no particles.  These
could be unsplit or cut cells (if they have zero flow volume).  Both
of these kinds of cells will compute a zero result for all the
individual values.  Likewise, split cells store no particles and will
produce a zero result.  This is because their sub-cells actually
contain the particles that are geometrically inside the split cell.
</P>
<P>The array can be accessed by any command that uses per-grid
values from a compute as input.  See <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_4">Section
4.4</A> for an overview of SPARTA output
options.
</P>
<P>The per-grid array values for the first column of the array
will be in distance <A HREF = "units.html">units</A>.  The second column of the
array will be time distance divided by time <A HREF = "units.html">units</A>.
The third column of the array will be dimensionless.

<P>Styles with a <I>kk</I> suffix are functionally the same as the
corresponding style without the suffix.  They have been optimized to
run faster, depending on your available hardware, as discussed in the
<A HREF = "Section_accelerate.html">Accelerating SPARTA</A> section of the manual.
The accelerated styles take the same arguments and should produce the
same results, except for different random number, round-off and
precision issues.
</P>
<P>These accelerated styles are part of the KOKKOS package. They are only
enabled if SPARTA was built with that package.  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_3">Making
SPARTA</A> section for more info.
</P>
<P>You can specify the accelerated styles explicitly in your input script
by including their suffix, or you can use the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_6">-suffix command-line
switch</A> when you invoke SPARTA, or you can
use the <A HREF = "suffix.html">suffix</A> command in your input script.
</P>
<P>See the <A HREF = "Section_accelerate.html">Accelerating SPARTA</A> section of the
manual for more instructions on how to use the accelerated styles
effectively.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>To use this compute, a collision style must be defined via the
<A HREF = "collide.html">collide</A> command, which defines properties for the
mixture <I>species</I>.
</P>
<P>As explained above, to use this compute with <I>nrho</I> or <I>temp</I> defined
as input from a <A HREF = "fix_ave_grid.html">fix ave/grid</A> command, this compute
must only be invoked on timesteps that are multiples of the <I>Nfreq</I>
argument used by the fix, since those are the steps when it produces
output.
